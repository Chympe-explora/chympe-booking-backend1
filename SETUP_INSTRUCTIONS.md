## 🔧 Configuration

### wrangler.toml - ALREADY FIXED ✅

This file has been updated with:

```toml
# ✅ This is now correct:
SITE_BASE_URL = "https://chympe-explora.github.io/team-explo-era-site/"

# Your Telegram settings:
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "-1003766158262"
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID = "8550710288"
ADMIN_USER_IDS = "8550710288"
```

### Environment Secrets (First Time Only)

You need to set these one-time secrets. In terminal:

```bash
# Telegram bot token (from @BotFather)
wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
# → Paste your token → Press Enter → Ctrl+D (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows)

# Random secret for webhooks
wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_SECRET
# → Paste something like: abc123xyz789secret → Press Enter → Ctrl+D/Ctrl+Z

# Random secret for admin API
wrangler secret put ADMIN_API_SECRET
# → Paste something like: admin_secret_123 → Press Enter → Ctrl+D/Ctrl+Z
```

**Verify secrets are set:**
```bash
wrangler secret list
```

Should show all three secrets.

## 🚀 API Endpoints

Your backend provides these endpoints:

### Content & Pricing
```
GET  /api/content?site=root|krem-chympe|wilderness-expedition
GET  /api/prices?site=root
GET  /api/images?site=root
GET  /api/highlights?site=root
POST /api/calculate-price
```

### Bookings
```
POST /api/visit          ← User visits site
POST /api/tap            ← User taps item
POST /api/draft          ← User creates draft
POST /api/submit         ← User submits booking
GET  /api/status/:id     ← Check booking status
```

### AI Chat (ERA)
```
POST /api/era/message    ← Send message to AI
GET  /api/era/poll       ← Get AI response
POST /api/era/typing     ← User is typing
```

### Ratings
```
GET  /api/ratings?site=root
POST /api/ratings        ← Submit rating
```

## 🔄 Redeploy (After Making Changes)

If you make changes to the code:

```bash
# Edit files as needed

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main

# Deploy
npx wrangler deploy
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "wrangler: command not found"
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### "Cannot find module"
```bash
npm install
npx wrangler deploy
```

### "Unauthorized (401)" error
```bash
wrangler logout
wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy
```

### Deployment times out
```bash
# Try again (sometimes Cloudflare is slow)
npx wrangler deploy
```

### "KV namespace does not exist"
```bash
# The namespace ID might be wrong. Create a new one:
wrangler kv:namespace create BOOKINGS

# Copy the ID it gives you
# Open wrangler.toml and update the id in:
# kv_namespaces = [ { binding = "BOOKINGS", id = "PASTE_HERE" } ]

# Then redeploy
npx wrangler deploy
```

### API returns 404
```bash
# Check deployment was successful
wrangler deployments list

# If last deployment failed, redeploy
npm install
npx wrangler deploy
```

---

## 📋 Testing Endpoints

### Test if backend is running

```bash
curl https://chympe-booking-backend.workers.dev/api/content?site=root
```

Should return JSON with your site configuration.

### Test booking submission

```bash
curl -X POST https://chympe-booking-backend.workers.dev/api/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "9160018775",
    "package": "Cave Expedition",
    "total": 5000
  }'
```

Should return booking confirmation.

## 🔗 Integration with Frontend

The frontend (`team-eplo-era-site`) automatically connects to this backend.

**Frontend uses these endpoints:**
- Fetches site content from `/api/content`
- Submits bookings to `/api/submit`
- Gets prices from `/api/calculate-price`

**File that connects them:** `team-explo-era-site/live-content.js`

```javascript
// This is already set correctly:
const BACKEND_URL = "https://chympe-booking-backend.workers.dev";
```

---

## 📊 View Backend Logs

To see what's happening on your backend:

```bash
wrangler tail
```

This shows real-time logs of requests and errors.

---

## 🗑️ Reset Everything

If you want to start fresh:

```bash
# Delete all bookings and content from KV
wrangler kv:key delete --namespace-id cd92b965c0ed4581bebe2cb0b941d9cb "*"

# WARNING: This deletes everything! Use with caution.
```

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] You have Node.js installed
- [ ] You have Cloudflare account
- [ ] You have Telegram bot token
- [ ] `npm install` completed without errors
- [ ] `wrangler login` succeeded
- [ ] Secrets are set (`wrangler secret list`)
- [ ] `wrangler.toml` has correct `SITE_BASE_URL`

Then:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Wait for success message and test with curl.

## 🔐 Web Admin & Guide Dashboards (new)

Two new dashboards live in the site repo (`team-eplo-era-site-main`)
at `/admin/` and `/guide/` — see `WIRING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` there for
how to link/host them. They talk to this same Worker over the routes
in `admin-api.js` / `admin-auth.js`. Required secrets:

```
wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
```
Legacy master password — always works as a break-glass admin login,
even with zero admin accounts created.

```
wrangler secret put ADMIN_SIGNUP_CODE
```
Required before the admin dashboard's "Sign Up" tab will create new
admin accounts. Pick something long and random; share it only with
people who should get admin access. Without this secret set, sign-up
is disabled (login with `ADMIN_PASSWORD` still works).

### OTP delivery (password reset / account verification)
At least one of these should eventually be set, but **none are
required to get started** — if none are configured, OTP codes are
posted straight into your `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID` chat automatically
(you already have this secret set), so sign-up/reset works out of the
box while you decide on a paid SMS/email provider.

```
wrangler secret put TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID      # SMS via Twilio
wrangler secret put TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
wrangler secret put TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER

wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY          # Email via Resend
wrangler secret put RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
```

### CORS note
`corsHeaders()` in `booking.js` now also allows the `authorization`
header (needed for the dashboards' `Bearer <token>` requests) and the
`DELETE`/`PUT` methods (needed to remove a guide). If you had a custom
CORS setup, make sure it does the same or admin/guide API calls will
fail silently in the browser with no useful error.
